This is a partial implementation of the pybricks package that is normally
included in Pybricks MicroPython for EV3. It makes the PC look like an EV3 so
other EV3 bricks can connect to it and vice versa.

It has the same end user API, so the same documentation applies:
https://docs.pybricks.com/en/latest/messaging.html

This is a Python3 modification of the original Pybricks MicroPython version:
