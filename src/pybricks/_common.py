        Plays a sequence of musical notes. For example:

        Each note is a string with the following format:

            - The first character is the name of the note, ``A`` to ``G``
              or ``R`` for a rest.
            - Note names can also include an accidental ``#`` (sharp) or
              ``b`` (flat). ``B#``/``Cb`` and ``E#``/``Fb`` are not
              allowed.
            - The note name is followed by the octave number ``2``
              to ``8``. For example ``C4`` is middle C. The octave changes
              to the next number at the note C, for example, ``B3`` is the
              note below middle C (``C4``).
            - The octave is followed by ``/`` and a number that indicates
              the size of the note. For example ``/4`` is a quarter note,
              ``/8`` is an eighth note and so on.
            - This can optionally followed by a ``.`` to make a dotted
              note. Dotted notes are 1-1/2 times as long as notes without a
              dot.
            - The note can optionally end with a ``_`` which is a tie or a
              slur. This causes there to be no pause between this note and
              the next note.
