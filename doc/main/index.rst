   `Pybricks <https://pybricks.com/>`_ is Python coding for smart LEGO® hubs.
   Run MicroPython scripts
   directly on the hub, and get full control of your motors and sensors.

   Pybricks runs on LEGO® BOOST, City, Technic, MINDSTORMS®, and SPIKE®. You
   can code using Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, and Android.

   **What's on this page?**

   This page provides API documentation and short example snippets. If you're
   new to Pybricks, or if you're looking for bigger example projects, check out
   the `Pybricks website`_ instead.


   .. note:: Are you using LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3? Check out the
            `EV3 documentation`_ instead.


   **Installation**

   To run Pybricks MicroPython scripts, you must update the firmware on the
   hub. To get started, click one of the platforms below.

   .. list-table::

      * - **Technic, City, and BOOST Move Hubs**
        - **SPIKE Essential/Prime, and MINDSTORMS Inventor Hubs**

        - .. figure:: ../main/images/primeinventorhub.png
            :target: https://pybricks.com/install/spike-mindstorms/

   Once installed, Pybricks works the same for all hubs.
   check out the Pybricks modules in the left hand menu to see what
   you can do.
