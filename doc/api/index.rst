Pybricks API Documentation
==================================================================

This documentation has everything you need to install Pybricks and
run your first scripts.


**Step 1: Install Pybricks**

Pybricks scripts are the same across all hubs. The only difference is in how
you install Pybricks and how you run scripts. To get started, click one of
the platforms below.

.. list-table::

   * - **MINDSTORMS EV3**
     - **Powered Up (Technic/City/BOOST)**
     - **SPIKE / MINDSTORMS Inventor**

   * - .. image:: ../api/images/ev3brick.png
         :target: https://pybricks.com/install/mindstorms-ev3/installation

     - .. figure:: ../api/images/powereduphubs.png
         :target: https://pybricks.com/install/technic-boost-city/

     - .. figure:: ../api/images/primeinventorhub.png
          :target: https://pybricks.com/install/spike-mindstorms/


**Step 2: Start coding!**

After you've followed the installation steps for your hub,
check out the Pybricks modules in the left hand menu to see what
you can do.

**Step 3: Share what you made (or ask for help!)**
