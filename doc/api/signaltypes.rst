Signals and Units
=================

Many commands allow you to specify arguments in terms of well-known physical
quantities. This page gives an overview of each quantity and its unit.

Time
~~~~~~

.. _time:

time: ms
---------
All time and duration values are measured in milliseconds (ms).

For example, the duration of motion with ``run_time``, and the duration
of :func:`wait <.tools.wait>` are
specified in milliseconds.

Angles and angular motion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _angle:

angle: deg
-----------

All angles are measured in degrees (deg). One full rotation corresponds to 360
degrees.

For example, the angle values of a ``Motor`` or
the :meth:`GyroSensor <.ev3devices.GyroSensor.angle>` are expressed in degrees.

.. _speed:

rotational speed: deg/s
-----------------------

Rotational speed, or *angular velocity* describes how fast something rotates,
expressed as the number of degrees per second (deg/s).

For example, the rotational speed values of a ``Motor`` or the
:meth:`GyroSensor <.ev3devices.GyroSensor.speed>` are expressed in degrees
per second.

While we recommend working with degrees per second in your programs, you can
use the following table to convert between commonly used units.

+-----------+-------+-----------+
|           | deg/s | rpm       |
+-----------+-------+-----------+
| 1 deg/s = | 1     | 1/6=0.167 |
+-----------+-------+-----------+
| 1 rpm =   | 6     | 1         |
+-----------+-------+-----------+

.. _acceleration:

rotational acceleration: deg/s/s
--------------------------------

Rotational acceleration, or *angular acceleration* describes how fast the
rotational speed changes. This is expressed as the change of the number of
degrees per second, during one second (deg/s/s). This is also commonly written
as  :math:`deg/s^2`.

For example, you can adjust the rotational acceleration setting of a ``Motor``
to change how smoothly or
how quickly it reaches the constant speed set point.


Distance and linear motion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _distance:

distance: mm
-------------
Distances are expressed in millimeters (mm) whenever possible.

For example, the distance value of the :meth:`UltrasonicSensor
<.ev3devices.UltrasonicSensor.distance>` is measured in millimeters.

While we recommend working with millimeters in your programs, you can use the
following table to convert between commonly used units.

+---------+------+-----+--------+
|         | mm   | cm  | inch   |
+---------+------+-----+--------+
| 1 mm =  | 1    | 0.1 | 0.0394 |
+---------+------+-----+--------+
| 1 cm =  | 10   | 1   | 0.394  |
+---------+------+-----+--------+
| 1 inch =| 25.4 | 2.54| 1      |
+---------+------+-----+--------+

.. _dimension:

dimension: mm
-------------

Dimensions are expressed in millimeters (mm), just like
distances.

For example, the diameter of a wheel is measured in millimeters.

.. _linspeed:

speed: mm/s
------------
Linear speeds are expressed as millimeters per second (mm/s).

For example, the speed of a robotic vehicle is expressed in mm/s.

.. _linacceleration:

linear acceleration: mm/s/s
--------------------------------

Linear acceleration describes how fast the speed changes. This is expressed as
the change of the millimeters per second, during one second (deg/s/s).
This is also commonly written as  :math:`mm/s^2`.

For example, you can adjust the acceleration setting of a
:class:`DriveBase <.robotics.DriveBase>` to change how
smoothly or how quickly it reaches the constant speed set point.

Approximate and relative units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _percentage:

percentage: %
--------------

Some signals do not have specific units. They range from a minimum (0%) to a
maximum (100%). Specifics type of percentages are :ref:`relative distances
<relativedistance>` or  :ref:`brightness <brightness>`.

Another example is the sound volume,
which ranges from 0% (silent) to 100% (loudest).

.. _relativedistance:

relative distance: %
---------------------

Some distance measurements do not provide an accurate value with a specific
unit, but they range from very close (0%) to very far (100%). These are
referred to as relative distances.

For example, the distance value of the :meth:`InfraredSensor
<.ev3devices.InfraredSensor.distance>` is a relative distance.


.. _brightness:

brightness: %
--------------

The perceived brightness of a light is expressed as a percentage. It is 0% when
the light is off and 100% when the light is fully on. When you choose 50%, this
means that the light is perceived as approximately half as bright to the human
eye.

Force
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _force:

force: N
------------
Force values are expressed in newtons (N).

While we recommend working with newtons in your programs, you can use the
following table to convert to and from other units.

+---------+------+-------+-----------------------------+
|         | mN   | N     | lbf                         |
+---------+------+-------+-----------------------------+
| 1 mN =  | 1    | 0.001 | :math:`2.248 \cdot 10^{-4}` |
+---------+------+-------+-----------------------------+
| 1 N =   | 1000 | 1     | 0.2248                      |
+---------+------+-------+-----------------------------+
| 1 lbf = | 4448 | 4.448 | 1                           |
+---------+------+-------+-----------------------------+

Electricity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _voltage:

voltage: mV
--------------
Voltages are expressed in millivolt (mV).

For example, you can check the voltage of the battery.

.. _current:

current: mA
--------------

Electrical currents are expressed in milliampere (mA).

For example, you can check the current supplied by the battery.

.. _energy:

energy: J
--------------

Stored energy or energy consumption can be expressed in Joules (J).

.. _power:

power: mW
--------------

Power is the rate at which energy is stored or consumed. It is expressed in
milliwatt (mW).

Ambient environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _frequency:

frequency: Hz
--------------
Sound frequencies are expressed in Hertz (Hz).

For example, you can choose the frequency of a beep to change the pitch.

.. _temperature:

temperature: °C
---------------

Temperature is measured in degrees Celcius (°C). To convert to degrees
Fahrenheit (°F) or Kelvin (K), you can use the following conversion formulas:

    :math:`°\!F = °\!C \cdot \frac{9}{5} + 32`.

    :math:`K = °\!C + 273.15`.

.. _hue:

hue: deg
--------------
Hue of a color (0-359 degrees).
