Pybricks end-user API & Documentation
=====================================

This repository documents the Pybricks end-user MicroPython API.

Each `Pybricks firmware`_ comes with the `Pybricks package`_. All modules,
classes, methods, and functions in that package have optimized implementations
in C for high performance and reduced memory footprint.

This repository provides an empty, pure Python blueprint of that package. It is
used to generate the `official documentation`_.
See the `contributor's guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for acceptable changes and
instructions to build the documentation locally.

You can use the API stubs in this repository for syntax highlighting and code 
completion when programming the EV3 with VS Code. To enable, remove the 
``"python.languageServer"="None"`` line in the ``.vscode/settings.json`` file
generated by the *LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 MicroPython* extension.

For general discussion, please visit the `support`_ issue tracker.
